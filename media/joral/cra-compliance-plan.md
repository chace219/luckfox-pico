# CRA Compliance Plan — Media Gateway & SatiSense Edge

*Prepared 2026-07-26 from `CRA_Gateway_Requirements_1.docx` (internal Joral engineering
reference for Regulation (EU) 2024/2847, Annex I & II) plus a code-level audit of both
product trees. Status column reflects the codebase as of commit `8cff5d0e9`.*

## Key dates

- **11 September 2026** — vulnerability/incident reporting obligations begin (applies to already-shipped units).
- **11 December 2027** — full CRA compliance (CE marking, technical file, labeling) for products newly placed on the EU market.

## Kernel of the requirements doc

1. **Annex I Part I — eight built-in security properties**: secure-by-default config, no known CVEs at shipment, protected credentials/config data, minimized attack surface, access control on write paths, security-event logging, a reliable (ideally signed) update mechanism, factory reset to a known-secure state.
2. **Annex I Part II — vulnerability-handling process**: SBOM per release, ability to assess/fix reported vulnerabilities quickly, plain-language security fix notes, coordinated disclosure channel, periodic security testing (e.g. fuzzing protocol parsers).
3. **Annex II — accurate facts for the compliance file** (Carl/product management owns the file; engineering owns accuracy): exact version/build-ID scheme, true default open ports/services list, real update procedure, honest deployment assumptions ("isolated machine control network").

## Gap inventory (audited 2026-07-26)

| # | Annex I requirement | Media Gateway | SatiSense Edge |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Secure by default | ⚠️ default `admin`/`joral` (`src/web/cgi-lib/webauth.sh`), HTTP-only console (`tls_on()` returns 1) | ⚠️ same default creds; OPC UA `security: none` default (`gateway.json`), web TLS off by default, stunnel init fails open (`scripts/init.d/S60intelligence-edge`) |
| 2 | No known CVEs at shipment | ⚠️ no CVE-check process; shared rootfs ships OpenSSL 1.1.1 (EOL, ADR-127) | same |
| 3 | Data confidentiality/integrity | ✅ console pw salted-SHA-256; config plaintext but secret-free | ❌ MQTT pw + OPC UA pw + LLM API key plaintext in `gateway.json` (`core/config.c:1302,1333,1422`), served to browser by `web/cgi/api-config.sh:24` over plain HTTP |
| 4 | Minimize attack surface | ❌ shared Luckfox rootfs boots telnetd, sshd, adbd, Samba; root pw `luckfox` (`luckfox_pico_defconfig:16`) | same (shared rootfs) |
| 5 | Access control | ✅ all CGIs gated by `require_auth`; CAN ports :8000/:8001 unauthenticated by protocol design | ✅ web gated; OPC UA anonymous by default (ADR-107 trusted-LAN); Sign/Encrypt implemented but opt-in (`core/opcua_security.c`) |
| 6 | Security-event logging | ❌ zero logging of logins/failures/config changes (no `logger` calls in any CGI) | same |
| 7 | Update mechanism | ❌ no in-product updater; host reflash only (SocToolKit/`upgrade_tool`), unsigned images | same, and undocumented in manuals |
| 8 | Factory reset | ⚠️ manual file-deletion procedure documented only | ❌ none (Utilities page = export/import + restart) |

Cross-cutting: media-gateway `docs/manual/user-manual.md:425` and `docs/project-context.md:77`
still claim "no authentication (v1)" — contradicts shipped code; fix for Annex II accuracy.
httpd + CGIs run as root (accepted in `project-context.md:78`). No firewall ruleset shipped.
No LICENSE file in media-gateway. SatiSense config import has no schema validation
(`web/cgi/api-config.sh:15-19`).

## Closed since the audit

*Appended as items land. The table above stays a snapshot of the 2026-07-26 audit.*

- **2026-07-31 — SatiSense Edge, Annex I #4 (minimise attack surface):** the OPC UA
  server advertised the OPC Foundation-deprecated `Basic128Rsa15` (SHA-1 + PKCS#1 v1.5)
  and `Basic256` (SHA-1) security policies, because open62541's
  `setDefaultWithSecurityPolicies` registers every policy it implements.
  `core/opcua_security.c` now removes both from `config->securityPolicies` *and* from
  the endpoint list — deleting the policies matters, since open62541 resolves an
  OpenSecureChannel request by policy URI from that array rather than from the
  advertised endpoints, so hiding the endpoints alone would have left them
  negotiable. Only `Basic256Sha256` and `Aes128Sha256RsaOaep` are served (plus
  `None`, discovery-only). Evidence: `core/opcua_security.c` `drop_deprecated_policies()`.
  **Needs a reflash to take effect on already-flashed units.**
- **2026-07-31 — SatiSense Edge, Annex I #3 (confidentiality) enabler:** on-device
  certificate generation produced certificates that no conforming OPC UA client would
  accept — `core/certgen.c` omitted the `nonRepudiation` and `dataEncipherment`
  KeyUsage bits required by OPC UA Part 6 §6.2.2, and marked the extension critical,
  so UaExpert refused CreateSession with `BadCertificateUseNotAllowed`. In practice
  this meant the *only* transport-security control on the primary northbound could not
  be switched on by an operator using the documented procedure. Fixed and locked in by
  `tests/test_certgen.c`. Relevant to Annex I #1 too: the secure mode has to be usable
  before "secure by default" is a meaningful target.

Both fixes were **validated on hardware 2026-07-31** — an OPC UA Sign & Encrypt session
from UaExpert now establishes against the RV1106, where before the fix the client
refused the server certificate outright. Both defects were found by *executing* TC-S3
on hardware rather than by review: neither is visible in a code read, and the product
had carried them through every prior release. That is evidence for treating the
"periodic security testing" line of Annex I Part II as a scheduled activity with a
hardware bench in the loop, not a release-time checkbox.

- **2026-07-31 — SatiSense Edge, Annex I #1 (secure by default) + availability:** enabling
  web-console TLS required an operator to place a certificate by hand, and a missing one
  silently downgraded the console to plain HTTP. `S60intelligence-edge` now generates
  **this unit's own** certificate when `web.tls` is set, so TLS can be turned on from
  configuration alone. A proposal to embed certificate PEMs in the firmware image was
  **rejected**: an image-embedded private key is byte-identical on every unit shipped
  (CWE-321), so recovering it from one device would compromise the console TLS of the
  entire fleet — strictly worse than the `admin`/`joral` default already in the table
  above. Per-device generation gives the same zero-touch result with a unique key per
  unit. `.gitignore` blocks `*.pem`/`*.key`/`*.der`/`*.p12`/`*.pfx` to catch a stray
  local keygen.
- **2026-07-31 — SatiSense Edge, availability defect found by procedure review:** the
  same init script moved httpd to loopback *before* starting stunnel and never verified
  stunnel came up, so a malformed certificate left the console unreachable from the
  network **while printing `(https:8080)` as if it had succeeded**. An operator following
  the documented HTTPS procedure could lose console access and be told it worked. The
  script now polls the public port and rolls back to plaintext if stunnel is not
  listening. Verified against a stubbed-device harness across all five branches; the
  same harness reproduces the lockout on the pre-fix script.

- **2026-08-06 — SatiSense Edge, Annex I #3 (data confidentiality): stored secrets
  no longer in gateway.json, and never served to the browser.** The three secrets
  (`mqtt.password`, `opcua.password`, `llm.api_key`) now live in a root-only 0600
  sidecar (`/etc/intelligence-edge/gateway.json.secrets`), written atomically and
  created 0600 from the first byte. `gateway.json` — the file the console
  round-trips, the Utilities page exports and imports — is secret-free by
  construction. The console API was redesigned around that: `api-config.sh` GET
  serves a **redacted** view (a stored secret appears only as the
  `__SECRET_UNCHANGED__` sentinel — not even its length is disclosed), and POST
  resolves sentinels back against the device's stored values via the daemon's
  `--config-ingest`, which also gives config saves a real JSON parse check
  (closing the "no schema validation on import" cross-cutting note at the parse
  level). Web TLS stays **opt-in** per the current posture, which is exactly why
  the design never relies on the transport: no stored secret crosses the wire in
  either direction, HTTP or HTTPS. Units flashed before the change migrate
  automatically — the daemon detects legacy in-file plaintext at boot and rewrites
  the pair once — and the legacy file is redacted correctly even before migration.
  Secret fields in the console (MQTT password, OPC UA password, LLM API key) use a
  shared `SecretField` that renders "stored — type to replace", keeps on empty,
  and clears only via an explicit button. Contract pinned by 24 new checks in
  `tests/test_config_json.c` (`make test-config`), including sidecar mode 0600,
  no-secret-key-in-config, sentinel keep/replace/clear resolution, and
  legacy-plaintext redaction. **Needs a reflash (or daemon update) to take
  effect; validation of the CGI path on hardware is pending the next bench
  session.** Remaining for row #3: secrets are restricted, not encrypted at rest
  (no key store on this platform — accepted for now, revisit with the OpenSSL 3
  migration).
- **2026-08-06 — SatiSense Edge, Annex I #8 (factory reset): implemented.**
  `satisense-factory-reset` (installed to `/usr/sbin`) wipes every category of
  operator data — configuration, the secrets sidecar, the console login, all TLS
  keys/certificates, the OPC UA trust/issuer/CRL dirs, learned AI state,
  operator-added KB manuals, sessions and logs — then restores pristine factory
  defaults (`gateway.json` + the manual KB seed) from a new read-only staging area
  `/usr/share/intelligence-edge/factory` and reboots. Reachable two ways: the
  console's Utilities page (typed `RESET` confirmation + explicit dialog, POST-only
  CGI that re-checks a server-side confirm phrase) and by hand over serial/SSH for
  a locked-out operator. The wipe logic that ships is the wipe logic that is
  tested: the script takes a path-prefix override and
  `tests/test_factory_reset.sh` (now part of `make test`) pins the factory-state
  contract, including the degraded no-factory-dir case. Media Gateway (row #8
  ⚠️) still has only the documented manual procedure.

**Status 2026-07-31 (end of day):** all of the above is now **in a flashed firmware image
and confirmed on hardware**. The console runs over HTTPS with a per-device certificate,
plain HTTP is refused on the same port, and the OPC UA server runs Sign & Encrypt with
username auth and an enforcing client trust list. Gap-table row #1 (secure by default)
and row #3 (data confidentiality) improve materially for SatiSense Edge — though row #1
is not closed: `opcua.security` and `web.tls` are still **opt-in**, and the default
`admin`/`joral` console credential is untouched. Remaining from this thread: MQTT TLS
(TC-S3 leg c) has still never run, and the media-gateway console remains HTTP-only.

## Default network exposure (Annex II facts, current truth)

- Platform (both, from shared rootfs): :22 sshd, :23 telnetd, :139/:445 Samba, adbd over USB, serial getty, root/`luckfox`.
- Media Gateway: :80 web console, :8000/:8001 CAN↔Ethernet UDP/TCP (unauthenticated), br0 L2 bridge (T1S↔100BASE-TX).
- SatiSense Edge: :8080 web console (https via stunnel opt-in), :4840 OPC UA (anonymous default); outbound only: Modbus TCP :502, EtherNet/IP scanner, MQTT :1883/:8883, LLM HTTPS.

## Action plan (agreed priority order)

1. **Compliance matrix per product** — `docs/compliance/cra-annex1-matrix.md` in each tree, one row per requirement → status → evidence paths. Engineering input to Carl's technical file; update per release.
2. **SBOM from the build** — wire Buildroot `make legal-info` into the image build + small hand manifest for app-layer deps (open62541, libmodbus, EIPScanner, stunnel, OpenSSL). Cheapest item; close first.
3. **Annex II fact sheet per product** — version/build-ID scheme, ports table above, update procedure, deployment-assumption statement (matches ADR-107).
4. **Gap backlog with CRA dates as milestones**:
   a. strip telnetd/adbd/Samba + change root password in production images;
   b. signed firmware update path — flag to Carl per the doc;
   c. factory-reset function (both products) — **SatiSense done 2026-08-06**, media-gateway open;
   d. security-event logging (`logger` calls in `webauth.sh` + config CGIs);
   e. encrypt-or-restrict secrets in `gateway.json` — **done (restrict) 2026-08-06**, see above;
   f. OpenSSL 1.1.1 migration plan.
5. **Disclosure channel** — once Carl creates the security email alias, reference it in on-device Help + manuals via the `/help-docs` pipeline.

Out of scope for engineering: CE marking, business classification, EU Declaration of
Conformity (product/legal level).
